COMP 490-002 HW assignment submission

This program uses a single function that takes a state abbreviation (DE, NJ, or PA) with a list of items to purchase of the same data class.
With it, this program calculates the total cost of the list of items by calculating each item's price after sales tax and totals them together.
Thare no errors found within the program and a linter/tester was set up through Github actions. It consists of only two files, 'main.py' and 'testing.py.'

The function passes all created tests and can be seen in the latest Github Actions workflow runs. 
If instead, you want to test the program manually, there is a 'testing.py' file within the tests folder. 
You can clone the project and call each testing functions inside the same file.
